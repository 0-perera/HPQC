# part 2
## hello_world
Meaninful difference of runtime, faster for c++, since the python code has to be run through an interpreter first

## repeat_adder
for small input value, both languages run fast, but the larger the input values, the greater the difference of speed between C and python, being Python the slowest.

# part 3
It is shown again the outperformance of C compared to Python.
In terms of the function used to obtain the running time within the codes; C offers high precision in nanoscale, while Python has a lower precision since it is given first in floats term

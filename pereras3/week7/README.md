I created two loops, to process the same qubit through all the gates.
One loop is for the magnitude changes, while the other is for rotations an dphase shift.
I encounter different problems while putting together the code, it would work in spyder but not in github. 
However, is only for the probabiliy part that was not working now, the simple version where the weights
were not added worked fine, but since i could not get this one to work i could not move fpward to part 2
